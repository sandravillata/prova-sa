Hi. Welcome.

<p><b> In this experiment you will read English sentences, and determine if they sound grammatical to you.</b>
  
  <p>By grammatical, we mean whether you think a native speaker of English could say this sentence in a conversation.
  In other words, do you think it would sound odd for your friends to say this to you, as if they don’t speak English natively?
<br>We are <b>not</b> concerned with whether the sentence would be graded highly by a writing teacher.

<p>You will rate the sentence on a scale from 1 (very bad) to 7 (very good) by using your <b>mouse</b>. Alternatively, you can also use the number keys (from 1 to 7) on your keyboard to express your judgment.</p>
 <p> Here are three examples: one that is very bad, one that is in middle of the scale, and one that is very good.
  
  <br><i>The was insulted waitress frequently.</i>  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rating : 1 </b>
  <br><i>Tanya danced with as handsome a boy as her father.</i>   <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Rating : 4 </b>
  <br><i>This is a pen.</i>   <b> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rating: 7 </b>

<p>Don’t think about each sentence too much: <b> there are no right or wrong answers</b>. We are interested in the first opinion you form about the sentences.

<p><b>This is not a memory test or any other trick.</b> We’re linguists, and we study language.</p>
<p>There are 31 sentences for you to judge.</p>
  
<p>Sometimes you will be asked to provide a short answer to open-ended questions by typing your answer in a box on the screen.</p>
